EMPIRE_DESIGN_atreides:0 "House Atreides"
EMPIRE_DESIGN_atreides_desc:0 "The legend stated that the Atreides family came from a noble family that originated in Greece on Earth, and that they rose to prominence during the Butlerian Jihad. They claimed to descent from King Agamemnon, a son of Atreus, in Greek mythology. The descendants of Atreus are called "Atreides". \n\nThis Royal House had perfected a form of government that resulted in a well-organized society and a spiritually satisfied people. Furthermore, House Atreides kept Caladan a lush, prosperous paradise with relatively low industrial levels. \n\nThe House was also proficient in war; it maintained Swordmasters, Warmasters and Mentats to train and lead their army, and had even developed its own Battle Language."

EMPIRE_DESIGN_harkonnen:0 "House Harkonnen"
EMPIRE_DESIGN_harkonnen_desc:0 "After many centuries as a House Minor, Harkonnen influence gradually rose within the Landsraad, due mostly to shrewd manipulation of the whale fur market, thanks to the efforts of Baron Dmitri Harkonnen and his son Vladimir. \n\nThey built its power by maximizing production output and minimizing their expenses, ignoring economically ethical behaviour. \n\nHarkonnen governing is based upon a simple foundation of fear and terror. They are used in governance, in the day-to-day running of the Harkonnen household, and in controlling the Harkonnen armies. \n\nWith a social order based on treachery and punishment, soldiers rose through the ranks through deceit, trickery and, if necessary, assassination."

EMPIRE_DESIGN_corrino:0 "House Corrino"
EMPIRE_DESIGN_corrino_desc:0 "The events after the Battle of Corrin saw the newly formed House Corrino capture rulership of the new Imperium, maintaining a firm grip on the Empire over the subsequent millennia. \n\nDuring their Imperial rule, House Corrino maintained arguably the most powerful army in the known universe, the Sardaukar. Formed by prisoners from Salusa Secundus, their superior abilities were capable of crushing any military opposition. It was said that only the combined forces of all the Great Houses of the Landsraad could defeat such incredible force. \n\nTo keep their seat in the throne, they will backstab and use treacherous tactics, but without getting openly involved, using other houses to make their dirt work."

EMPIRE_DESIGN_fremen:0 "Fremen"
EMPIRE_DESIGN_fremen_desc:0 "To the Fremen, the fight for survival had long dominated their cultural identity. Descendants from the Zensunni Wanderers, these people had to adapt to the brutal environment of Arrakis and his frugal use of energy and resources, especially water. \n\nAdditionally, their history with cultural persecution mandated the need for combat knowledge, creating a group of efficient and hardy warriors, who used their skills and the environment of Arrakis to fend off off-world opponents who often possessed superior technology and training. \n\nWater plays a vital role in the Fremen culture, a representation of life itself. When one of then dies, his water is removed from their body and returned to the tribe."

EMPIRE_DESIGN_benegesserit:0 "Bene Gesserit Sisterhood"
EMPIRE_DESIGN_benegesserit_desc:0 "The origins of the Bene Gesserit are widely unknown at a point that the only verifiable fact is that the Bene Gesserit arose during the political turmoil that followed the Butlerian Jihad, quickly establishing themselves as an influential political force among other houses. \n\nFor millennia, the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood chose to exercise its power by acting in the background of imperial politics, through their breeding program, their placement of agents in the imperial court and Great Houses and their provision of services such as the mediation in disputes and overseers of negotiations. \n\nTheir real agenda, however, is far from completion and just a handful of people truly understands their final goal."

EMPIRE_DESIGN_guild:0 "Spacing Guild"
EMPIRE_DESIGN_guild_desc:0 "Details of the Guild's emergence are contentious, although it is believed they emerged as a serious political and economic force around the time of The Great Convention. \n\nThe Spacing Guild was by its very nature a secretive organization that took up functions previously covered by the Thinking Machines, just as Mentats and the Bene Gesserit did. \n\nTheir very existence rests on the proprietary knowledge of folding space, the only reliable method of traveling among the stars. \n\nThe inner structure of the Guild is a well keep mystery, even for nobles of the Great Houses. The role of Guild Navigator is the most prestigious part inside the organization, although just a few know where they really come from."

START_SCREEN_dune:0 "A beginning is a very delicate time. It is the year 10191 and known universe is ruled by the Padisha Emperor Shaddam IV, my father. In this time, the most precious substance in the Universe is the spice. It extends life. It expands consciousness. It is vital to space travel. \n\nThe Spacing Guild and its navigators, who the spice has mutated over four-thousand years, use the orange spice gas, which gives them the ability to fold space, to travel to any part of the Universe without moving. \n\nThe spice exists on only one desolate, dry planet with vast deserts. Hidden away within the rocks are a people known as the Fremen, who have long held a prophecy, that a messiah would lead them to true freedom. This planet is Arrakis, also known as Dune. \n\nPrinces Irulan"
